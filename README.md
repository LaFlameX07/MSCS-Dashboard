# MSCS Dashboard

In this Dashboard I intend to create several visualizations in order to make the numbers and statistics of MSCS societies more interesting. 
The visualizations that I've used are as follows:
1. Total count of societies in the dataset.
2. Table count of no. of districts classified according to each sector type.
3. A piechart that shows percent of societies in per society type. When hovered upon particular pie it shows more info regarding the percent and count of societies. Also one can also see how the distribution would look like without the absence of certain sector type simply by clicking on any of the types present in the key/legend section. 
4. A piechart that shows distribution of societies by states. When hovered upon particular pie it shows more info regarding the percent and count of societies. Also one can also see how the distribution would look like without the absence of certain sector type simply by clicking on any of the types present in the key/legend section. 
5. A line chart that shows the no. of registrations made by the societies according to different times. One can also look at different time frames by clicking and dragging the cursor according to your needs to zoom and see at which dates societies got registered. 
6. A horizontal bar chart that shows top 10 districts in the country ordered by count of societies in descending. Also it can be zoomed according to user's needs.
7. A stacked bar chart that shows distribution of societies and their respective types plotted by states. One can see the count of societies in each sector distinctively in states.
8. A scatter plot that displays the count of societies on y axis and states/districts on x axis with the circles colored according to dominant sector type in each state/district. The user have option to choose between state or district. When hovered upon the circles one can see total count of societies, the most dominant sector in each state/district and how much percent do those sector type represent. 

I made my Dashboard in Python and used several libraries to create it. There is single piece of code and there is no need of images or files to be downloaded all it requires is stable internet connection to run.


All in all my Dashboard intends to make use of every attribute of the dataset so that as much data as possible can be shared with the users. It also intends to make graphs and charts interesting. This Dashboard stands upon all parameters and displays data in most optimal and presentable manner. Also the Dashboard I created closely resembles the already existing MSCS website and would be easy to integrate into the existing system.
This code was made using Python 3.11 and I used Python IDLE to make it. It makes use of many libraries so make sure that they are downloaded in your computer. The libraries used are pandas,dash and plotly and can be downloaded by running pip install dash on your command prompt. Make sure the Python version is up to date. When the code is executed, it runs on 127.0.0.1:8050 and it may take time to load according to your internet connection. As the code uses elements and links from the internet, one must have stable internet connection. Once you fill in all the requirement boxes, you're good to go.
Hope you would like this project. 
Thanking You,
